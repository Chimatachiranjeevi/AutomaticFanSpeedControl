# **AUTOMATIC FAN SPEED CONTROL**

## **ABSTRACT**

Technology is speeding quickly these days, and it has fully taken over people's lives. Despite the fact that technology plays such an important role in our daily lives, there are those whose lifestyles are completely unrelated to this well-known term. As a result, it is our obligation to design a few dependable methods that they can employ effectively. One of these is the Automatic Room Temperature Controlled Fan Speed Controller. The designed technology creates an atmosphere in which the fan speed is controlled by the system rather than the user. By monitoring the room temperature, you can change the fan speed automatically. These fascinating initiatives to construct intelligent systems are aimed at making life easier for humans. The circuit was created utilising electronic components that were readily available in the area.

# **DESCRIPTION**

This project is a self-contained automatic fan speed controller that regulates the speed of an electric fan to meet our needs. This closed loop feedback control system is efficient and reliable thanks to the use of embedded technology. The ATmega328 microcontroller enables for dynamic and speedier control. The microcontroller, which controls all of the circuit's functions, is its beating heart. The temperature sensor LM35 detects the temperature and converts it to an electrical signal that the microcontroller may use. The measured temperature values are presented on the LCD panel at the same time. The fan speed is controlled by the microcontroller via the motor driver. A controlled 12V, 2A power source is used in this project. This project can be used in the process industry to maintain and manage the temperature of boilers.
